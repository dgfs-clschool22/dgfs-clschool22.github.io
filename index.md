# DGfS Computational Linguistics Fall School 2022
  
The [Computational Linguistics Fall School](https://dgfs.de/en/cl/fall-schools.html) was established in 2001 by the [Special Interest Group on Computational Linguistics](https://dgfs.de/en/cl/) of the [German Linguistic Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Sprachwissenschaft, DGfS)](https://dgfs.de/en/).

Since then, the fall school is a biennial event for students who wish to broaden their knowledge of techniques and methods used in natural language processing, including computational linguistics fields not traditionally taught in standard degree programs. Due to the corona pandemic, the event had to be canceled for the last two years.

This is the 11th fall school offering four courses, each of which consists of ten 90-minutes lectures. All courses will be taught in English.
