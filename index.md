# DGfS Computational Linguistics Fall School 2022
  
The [Computational Linguistics Fall School](https://dgfs.de/en/cl/fall-schools.html) was established in 2001 by the [Special Interest Group on Computational Linguistics](https://dgfs.de/en/cl/) of the [German Linguistic Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Sprachwissenschaft, DGfS)](https://dgfs.de/en/).

Since then, the fall school is a biennial event for students who wish to broaden their knowledge of techniques and methods used in natural language processing, including computational linguistics fields not traditionally taught in standard degree programs. Due to the corona pandemic and the unknown regulations in September, the fall school can only be offered for one week. 

This is the 11th fall school offering two courses, each of which consists of ten 90-minutes lectures. All courses will be taught in English.
