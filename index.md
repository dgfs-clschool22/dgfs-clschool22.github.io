# DGfS Computational Linguistics Fall School 22
  
The [Computational Linguistics Fall School](https://dgfs.de/en/cl/fall-schools.html) was established in 2001 by the Special Interest Group on Computational Linguistics of the German Linguistic Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Sprachwissenschaft, DGfS).

Since then, the fall school is a biennial event for students who wish to broaden their knowledge of techniques and methods used in natural language processing, including computational linguistics fields not traditionally taught in standard degree programs. Because of the Corona-Pandemic, we were not able to host the event for the last two years.

This is the 11th fall school offering four courses, each of which consists of ten 90-minutes lectures. All courses will be taught in English. Students can receive credits for the courses at their home university under the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS).
